## Why This Exists

Artificial Intelligence is reshaping every industry, yet access to quality, structured AI education is often locked behind paywalls or expensive degrees. This project offers a **comprehensive, open-source curriculum** for learning AI engineering, covering fundamentals to cutting-edge topics like:

- Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- Math for AI  
- Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and RL 
- Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- Agentic AI, RAG, Prompt Engineering  
- Real-world Projects and Deployment  

Everything here is **free**, self-paced, and community-curated.



## Curriculum Overview

## Goals

- Build a **portfolio-ready** skill set for AI engineering
- Learn from **world-class courses** (MIT, Stanford, Fast.ai, etc.)
- Practice through **projects** and **community feedback**
- Stay current with **2025+ AI advancements**


## Learning Philosophy

- **Theory + Practice**: Understand the "why", but focus on building.
- **Modular**: Learn in blocks; specialize when you're ready.
- **Community-Driven**: Suggest, improve, and contribute!
- **Always Up-To-Date**: We update with AI trends, not semesters.

## How to Use This

1. Start from the top of the [curriculum](./curriculum)
2. Work at your own pace — most tracks list beginner → advanced
3. Track your progress in a fork or markdown file
4. Build portfolio projects as you go
5. Join discussions, contribute, and grow with others!
