## Why This Exists

Artificial Intelligence is reshaping every industry, yet access to quality, structured AI education is often locked behind paywalls or expensive degrees. This project offers a **comprehensive, open-source curriculum** for learning AI engineering, covering fundamentals to cutting-edge topics like:

- Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- Math for AI  
- Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and RL 
- Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- Agentic AI, RAG, Prompt Engineering  
- Real-world Projects and Deployment  

Everything here is **free**, self-paced, and community-curated.



## Curriculum Overview

| Track | Topics |
|-------|--------|
|  Programming | Python, Git, Linux, Data Structures |
| Math | Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, Stats |
|  ML | Supervised, Unsupervised, Model Evaluation |
|  Deep Learning | Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers |
|  Specializations | NLP, Computer Vision, RL |
|  Modern AI | LLMs, Agentic AI, RAG, Prompt Engineering |
|  Capstone | End-to-End AI Projects |

## Goals

- Build a **portfolio-ready** skill set for AI engineering
- Learn from **world-class courses** (MIT, Stanford, Fast.ai, etc.)
- Practice through **projects** and **community feedback**
- Stay current with **2025+ AI advancements**


## Learning Philosophy

- **Theory + Practice**: Understand the "why", but focus on building.
- **Modular**: Learn in blocks; specialize when you're ready.
- **Community-Driven**: Suggest, improve, and contribute!
- **Always Up-To-Date**: We update with AI trends, not semesters.

## How to Use This

1. Start with the [Foundational](./01_foundation/01_programming.md)
2. Work at your own pace — most tracks list beginner → advanced
3. Track your progress in a fork or markdown file
4. Build portfolio projects as you go
5. Join discussions, contribute, and grow with others!
