# Computer Vision for AI Engineering

Computer Vision (CV) enables machines to interpret and understand the visual world. It's the driving force behind technologies like facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, medical image analysis, and more.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand key concepts in image processing and computer vision
- Build and train deep learning models (CNNs) for image classification, object detection, and segmentation
- Work with OpenCV and deep learning frameworks for CV tasks
- Apply transfer learning using pre-trained models like ResNet and EfficientNet


## Why Itâ€™s Important

Computer Vision is a core specialization in AI. From healthcare to self-driving cars, it allows AI to see and make sense of the world. Learning CV equips you to build models that interact with the visual environment.
