# Capstone Projects

Capstone projects bring everything you’ve learned into **real-world, end-to-end AI solutions**. These projects are designed to showcase your ability to build, deploy, and explain practical AI systems.

You’ll define a problem, build models, fine-tune or apply LLMs, handle messy data, evaluate performance, and **deploy your solution** with appropriate tooling.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of your capstone experience, you should be able to:

- Design and implement production-grade AI systems
- Apply modern AI stacks (e.g., LLMs, RAG, vector DBs, orchestration tools)
- Handle real-world data imperfections and edge cases
- Integrate frontend/backend components (API, UI)
- Use industry tools: Git, Docker, CI/CD, FastAPI, LangChain
- Communicate your work clearly through README, demo, and documentation

## Capstone Ideas (2025-Ready)

Choose one or more projects below, or define your own!  
Keep your first capstone scoped to **2–4 weeks**.

### 1. AI Chat Assistant (RAG + LLM)

Build a domain-specific chatbot that answers questions from a private dataset using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

- **Stack**: LangChain / LlamaIndex, OpenAI / Cohere / Hugging Face LLMs, Chroma / Weaviate / FAISS
- **Bonus**: Add memory + streaming output; deploy with FastAPI + UI (Gradio/Next.js)

### 2. Image Classification & Inference API

Train a deep learning model to classify domain-specific images (e.g., skin lesions, plant diseases, food types).

- **Stack**: PyTorch/TensorFlow, FastAPI, TorchServe or ONNX
- **Bonus**: Include model explainability (Grad-CAM), and Dockerized API

### 3. AI for Structured Text Extraction

Build a pipeline that extracts structured data (e.g., invoice fields, resumes) from scanned or PDF documents.

- **Stack**: LayoutLM / Donut, PyMuPDF or pdfplumber, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Bonus**: Add UI for uploading PDFs + visual results

### 4. Multi-Agent AI Workflow Executor

Use **agentic AI patterns** to build an LLM agent that can autonomously perform tasks like summarizing news, scheduling, writing code, etc.

- **Stack**: LangGraph, OpenAI Function Calling, ReAct + Tool Use, SerpAPI, Browser tools
- **Bonus**: Enable multi-agent collaboration (Planner + Worker model)

### 5. Reinforcement Learning for Decision Tasks

Train an RL agent to solve a decision-making task or simulation — games, robotics, or operations research.

- **Stack**: OpenAI Gymnasium, Stable-Baselines3, custom reward design
- **Bonus**: Deploy as a microservice; visualize progress with TensorBoard

### 6. Fine-tune a LLaMA/ Mistral Model

Choose a domain (legal, medical, finance) and fine-tune a smaller open LLM on that data using QLoRA or DPO.

- **Stack**: Hugging Face Transformers + PEFT, LoRA, Weights & Biases for tracking
- **Bonus**: Evaluate with RAG vs. finetuned model performance

### 7. End-to-End AI SaaS App

Build a production-grade app using AI as a core backend engine. Examples:

- Resume Matcher (job description vs. applicant)
- Legal document summarizer
- AI-powered course recommender

- **Stack**: Next.js / Streamlit + FastAPI + VectorDB + OpenAI
- **Bonus**: Add login, usage tracking, and analytics

## Project Deliverables

- Clean and modular codebase
- Detailed `README.md`:
  - Problem statement
  - Architecture
  - Setup instructions
  - Demo or screenshots
- Deployed app or public demo (Spaces, Render, Hugging Face, etc.)
- Optional: Blog post or walkthrough video

## Final Capstone Checklist

- [ ] Solved a relevant, modern AI problem
