# Math for AI Engineering

Math is the backbone of AI and machine learning. To become an AI engineer, you need a solid understanding of the fundamental mathematical concepts that power algorithms, models, and data manipulation.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand core concepts in linear algebra, calculus, and statistics
- Apply these concepts to machine learning and deep learning algorithms
- Work with matrices, derivatives, integrals, and probability distributions
- Solve optimization problems and understand gradient descent


## Why Itâ€™s Important

The most powerful AI systems today are built on strong mathematical foundations. From the matrix operations that power neural networks to the calculus involved in optimization, math will help you understand how models work and how to improve them.
