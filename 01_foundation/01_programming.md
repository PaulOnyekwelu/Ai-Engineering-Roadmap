# Programming for AI Engineering

Programming is the foundation of AI engineering. Before diving into machine learning or building intelligent agents, you need to be comfortable writing, debugging, and collaborating on code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Write Python code using variables, functions, loops, and conditionals
- Work with data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples
- Understand OOP (object-oriented programming) in Python
- Use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Navigate and use the Linux command line
- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code
- Solve algorithmic problems and build small projects

## Why It’s Important

AI engineering isn’t just about models — it’s about building systems. That includes cleaning data, automating pipelines, integrating APIs, and deploying code. All of this requires solid programming fundamentals.
