# Machine Learning for AI Engineering

Machine Learning is at the core of AI. This module will teach you how machines learn from data and how to build systems that can predict and make decisions based on data.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand the key concepts in machine learning such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and model evaluation
- Implement machine learning algorithms using Python
- Understand the concepts of overfitting, underfitting, and bias-variance tradeoffs
- Work with real-world datasets, including preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation


## Why Itâ€™s Important

Machine Learning is the foundation of AI systems. Whether it's predicting outcomes, classifying data, or building intelligent agents, ML algorithms form the backbone of AI's decision-making capability.
